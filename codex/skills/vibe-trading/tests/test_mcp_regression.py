"""Regression tests: existing MCP server mode and no-config behavior.

These tests guard against regressions introduced by the MCP client integration:

1. no-config regression — build_registry() with no agent_config must behave
   identically to before this roadmap: local tools only, no exceptions.

2. MCP server mode regression — importing mcp_server.py must not raise, and
   the FastMCP instance must expose the expected well-known tool names. This
   confirms that the server-side MCP plugin (vibe-trading-mcp) is unaffected
   by the MCP client changes introduced in Phases 1-4.

IMPORTANT notes:
- These tests do NOT start the MCP server process (no mcp.run() call) — they
  only import the module and inspect the registered tool names, which is safe
  and fast.
- Do not add functional tests for individual mcp_server tools here; those
  belong in their own test files.
- TODO(v1): Add a live smoke test that spawns `vibe-trading-mcp` as a stdio
  subprocess once CI has network access and the SSE transport is tested end-
  to-end in Phase 6+.
